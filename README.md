# LightAircraftDesign
The MN-Kapota X project is a charity initiative in which the team competes in the Royal Aeronautical Society 2024 light aircraft competition. Their proposal involves designing a two-seater, all-electric aircraft for firefighting and delivery, which aligns with the theme of this year's competition.
